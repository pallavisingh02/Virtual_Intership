Let's dive into the data
------------------------------
-7 data sets - each data set contains different columns and values
- A data model - this shows the relationships between all of the data sets, as well as any links that you can use to merge tables.

DataModelling & requirement gathering:
---------------------------------------------

Refer: [DATAMD.png]  for data modelling structure

Identified Reaction, Content, and Reaction Types as our relevant data sets.Why?

- The brief carefully it states that the client wanted to see “An analysis of their content categories showing the top 5 categories with the largest popularity”.
- As explained in the data model, popularity is quantified by the “Score” given to each reaction type.
- We therefore need data showing the content ID, category, content type, reaction type, and reaction score.
- So, to figure out popularity, we’ll have to add up which content categories have the largest score.

Data Clenaing:
-----------------
Removed duplicate in excel \
Removed Null values\
Standardize column name


Task:
---------
Now we want to figure out the top 5 categories. 
1. Create a final data set by merging  three tables together\
    - Using the Reaction table as base table, then first join the relevant columns from  Content data set, and then the Reaction Types data set.\
 **used a “VLookUp” formula**
 2. Figure out the Top 5 performing categories\
    - For this Added up the total scores for each category.
    **used the “Sum If” formula**\

end result:
- A cleaned dataset
- The top 5 categories\

3. Structure presentation explaining insight
4. Presentated video of  presentation to  client and internal team members
